# Python tutorial
If you want to learn Python from scratch, start here.

There are countless great tutorials online, for any programming language you
want to learn. I will not repeat or replicate any of those but I will link
those here. This is to show and teach you that you do not have to rely on any
one tutorial, you can find everything you need with a little search.

One thing most tutorials lack is an exercise for the topic you just learned about.
Most tutorials teach you the theoretics but lack any exercise that could deepen
your knowledge.

This tutorial collects the (at the time of writing) best tutorials and adds
exercises to help you better understand the concepts and inner workings on Python.

You are encouraged to play around and try things out that are not in this tutorial.
